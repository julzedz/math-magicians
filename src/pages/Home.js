      Mathematics is generally defined as the science that deals with numbers.
      It involves operations among numbers, and it also helps you to calculate
      the product price, discounted prizes, and if you are good in
      maths, you can calculate very fast. Mathematicians and scientists rely
      on mathematical principles in their real-life to experiment with new
      things every day. Many students say ”I hate mathematics” and maths is
      a pointless subject, but it is wrong because without mathematics your life
      is tough to survive. Math has its applications in every field.

      One couldn’t imagine the world without math. Math makes our life
      systematic, and every invention involves math. No matter what action a
      person is doing, he should know some basic maths. Every profession
      involves maths. Our present-day world runs on computers, and even computer
      runs with the help of maths. Every development that happens requires math.
